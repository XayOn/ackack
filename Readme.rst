Attach a rtsp-enabled webcam to your weback vacuum robot and have fun with them!

This builds a web ui to control a weback vacuum robot with your arrow keys
(plus enter for start cleaning and backspace to stop), with a rtsp webcam
connected via hls (converted using ffmpeg).

This way you can remotely-scare your cats! I have it setup with traefik
(configure BASE_PATH env variable) + wireguard.
